How to Download: 
1. Download every file as a zip, extract on personal computer and then run file name: stupid_pong.py
2. Make sure to have python and pygame instead on computer, ideally in Visual Studio Code.
3. Have fun!

GAME DETAILS:
Simple game of pong! But with challenging twists that make the game much more difficult than it needs to be. Gimmicks such as swapping the axis the paddle lies on, randomly changing player key binds, and even a perfectly unnecessary but necessary perfect parry system just to make the player think more than just moving up and down to receive the ball.

Supports 2 players, player one on the left and player two on the right

NEW GIMMICKS TO GAMEPLAY: 
1. A full game rotation, where paddles move from left to right instead (W/Up arrow to move left, S/Down arrow to move right)
2. The pong paddles become Flappy Bird themselves, requiring constant inputs to move the paddles up (W/Up arrow, S/Down arrow)
3. The paddles become mini rockets, where they requiring holding the inputs to be launched upwards to hit the ball
4. Regular pong gameplay, expect the player inputs are randomly swapped around for the loser
5. The ball becomes a baseball, and requires constant parrying to hit it back upwards, but don't hit it too high!
